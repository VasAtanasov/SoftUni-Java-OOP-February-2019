# Lab: Unit Testing

Problems for exercises and homework for the "Java OOP" course @ SoftUni.

## Part I: Unit Testing Basics

### 0. Create Maven Project

Maven is build automation tool that takes care of dependencies for your project. Before you can make one, make sure that you enable the plugin in IntelliJ [File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Maven Integration]

![](./resources/media/image1.png)

Now, you can create a Maven project

![](./resources/media/image2.png)

Group Id should be separated by dots, Artifact Id should be separated by hyphens

![](./resources/media/image3.png)

If everything is ok, you should see the following project structure

![](./resources/media/image4.png)

Copy the files provided and place them in a package inside src/main/java folder

![](./resources/media/image5.png)

### 1. Test Axe

In test/java folder, create a package called rpg_tests

Create a class AxeTests

Create the following tests:

- Test if weapon loses durability after each attack
- Test attacking with a broken weapon

#### Solution

Create the new package rpg_tests and inside create the class AxeTests

![](./resources/media/image6.png)

Inside the class create your first test

![](./resources/media/image7.png)

Arrange preconditions

![](./resources/media/image8.png)

Execute tested behaviour

![](./resources/media/image9.png)

Assert postconditions

![](./resources/media/image10.png)

Create your second test method

![](./resources/media/image11.png)

Arrange preconditions and test behaviour

### 2. Test Dummy

Create a class DummyTests

Create the following tests:

- Dummy loses health if attacked
- Dead Dummy throws exception if attacked
- Dead Dummy can give XP
- Alive Dummy can't give XP

#### Hints

Follow the logic of the previous problem

### 3. Refactor Tests

Refactor the tests for Axe and Dummy classes

Make sure that:

- Names of test methods are descriptive
- You use appropriate assertions (assert equals vs assert true)
- You use assertion messages
- There are no magic numbers
- There is no code duplication (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

#### Hints

Extract constants and private fields for Axe class

![](./resources/media/image13.jpg)

Create a method that executes before each test

![](./resources/media/image14.png)

Make use of constants and private fields, as well as add assertion messages

![](./resources/media/image15.png)

Follow the same logic for other test methods and TestDummy class

## Part II: Dependencies

### 4. Fake Axe and Dummy

Test if hero gains XP when target dies

To do this, you need to: 

- Make Hero class testable (use Dependency Injection)
- Introduce Interfaces for Axe and Dummy
  - Interface Weapon
  - Interface Target

Create fake Weapon and fake Dummy for the test

### Hints

Create Weapon interface

![](./resources/media/image16.png)

Create Target interface

![](./resources/media/image17.png)

Implement interfaces

![](./resources/media/image18.png)

Modify implementation methods to make use of interfaces

![](./resources/media/image19.png)

Modify both Axe and Dummy classes

Use Dependency Injection for Hero class

![](./resources/media/image20.png)

Create HeroTests class and test gaining XP functionality by faking Weapon and Target classes

![](./resources/media/image21.png)

### 5. Mocking

Include Mockito in the project dependencies, then:

1. Mock fakes from previous problem
2. Implement Hero Inventory, holding unequipped weapons
    1. method - Iterable<Weapon> getInventory()
3. Implement Target giving random weapon upon death
   1. field - private List<Weapon> possibleLoot
4. Test Hero killing a target getting loot in his inventory

Hints
Locate pom.xml

![](./resources/media/image22.png)

Add Mockito dependency

![](./resources/media/image23.png)

Go to HeroTests and refactor the code, making use of Mockito

![](./resources/media/image24.png)

*Implement hero inventory and Target dropping loot functionalities
*Test Hero getting loot upon killing a Target
